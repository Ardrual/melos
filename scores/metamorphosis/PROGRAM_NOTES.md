## I. The Descending Tetrachord: A Brief History of Grief

The musical figure at the heart of this work—four notes descending stepwise: A, G, F, E—is among the oldest and most potent symbols in Western music. The Greeks called it the *tetrachord* (four strings), and it formed the basis of their modal system. But it was the Baroque era that discovered its true expressive power.

When Claudio Monteverdi set his "Lamento della Ninfa" (1638), he grounded the entire piece on this falling figure repeated endlessly in the bass. The nymph sings of love and loss while beneath her, gravity itself seems to pull the music downward. The technique spread rapidly: Henry Purcell's "Dido's Lament" (1689), perhaps the most famous aria in English opera, uses the same device as the Carthaginian queen sings "Remember me, but ah! forget my fate." The descent becomes fate itself.

The figure appears throughout Bach's work—the Crucifixus of the B Minor Mass descends through the tetrachord thirteen times as Christ is nailed to the cross. In the St. Matthew Passion, it underlies the opening chorus: a musical representation of humanity's fall from grace.

But here's the strange thing: the same four notes appear in Led Zeppelin's "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You," in the bass line of "Hit the Road Jack," in countless folk ballads from Appalachia to the British Isles. When someone leaves, when someone dies, when the world breaks your heart—music reaches for this same gesture. The descent is archetypal.

## II. On the Movements

### Movement I: Passacaglia — "The Weight of Descent"

**Form**: Ground bass (passacaglia) with eight variations

**Tempo**: ♩ = 56 (Grave)

**Character**: The word *passacaglia* likely derives from the Spanish *pasar* (to walk) and *calle* (street)—street music, parade music. But by the Baroque era, it had become something graver: a ceremonial form built on obsessive repetition.

The cello enters alone with the ground bass: A–G–F–E, each note occupying a full measure of 3/2. There is no accompaniment, no commentary—just the fall itself. The other instruments enter one by one across the first three variations, building a texture of communal grief.

Variation IV brings agitation; Variation V erupts into full storm. But the emotional peak is perhaps Variation VI, where after the fury, we suddenly drop to *pianissimo*. The bass continues its descent, but now the gesture feels less like grief and more like acceptance—or exhaustion.

The coda stretches the ground to double length, slowing time itself. The final notes disappear into silence.

### Movement II: Fuga — "Voices in Descent"

**Form**: Four-voice fugue, exposition–episodes–stretto–coda

**Tempo**: ♩ = 72 (Andante con moto)

**Character**: If the passacaglia is vertical (variations stacked atop an unchanging base), the fugue is horizontal (a single idea chasing itself through time and register). The fugue subject extends our tetrachord into a complete thought:

```
A - G - F - E - F - G - A
(descent)  (partial recovery)
```

This shape—falling, then struggling partway back—gives the subject its character. Pure descent would be static; this has drama.

The exposition proceeds traditionally: first violin states the subject, second violin answers at the dominant (E minor), viola and cello follow. The countersubject provides rhythmic contrast. Episodes develop the material sequentially, and middle entries explore the relative major (C) and subdominant (D minor).

The climax is the *stretto*, where subject entries overlap before each has finished—voices piling atop one another in a kind of controlled chaos. A dominant pedal (the cello holding E for four bars) prepares the final statement.

The fugue ends not in triumph but in a dying fall: the subject stated one last time, *piano*, dissolving.

### Movement III: Intermezzo — "Night Song (After the Storm)"

**Form**: Ternary (ABA')

**Tempo**: ♩. = 48 (Lento)

**Key**: F major (relative major of A minor)

**Character**: After the relentless descent of the first two movements, we need breath. This intermezzo provides it.

The shift to compound meter (6/8) transforms the character completely. Where the passacaglia and fugue were processional and argumentative, this is intimate—music for 3 AM, for the hour when grief exhausts itself into something approaching peace.

The cello now sings a long-breathed melody while the second violin provides shimmering, almost impressionistic arpeggios. The tetrachord is still present (now as F–E–D–C, the same shape in the new key), but it feels less like lament and more like lullaby.

The B section moves to D minor—darker, more restless—before the return of the opening material. The final bars float upward, settling on F major. Not resolution exactly, but rest.

### Movement IV: Toccata — "Dance on the Grave"

**Form**: Introduction – A (dance) – B (trio) – A' – Coda

**Tempo**: ♩ = 168 (Vivace)

**Meter**: 7/8 (grouped 3+2+2)

**Character**: The *toccata* was originally a genre of keyboard music designed to show off virtuosity—"touch pieces" from the Italian *toccare*. This one aims for a different kind of display: the transmutation of grief into fierce joy.

The 7/8 meter creates an asymmetrical, propulsive energy—a stumbling run, a dance that never quite finds its footing but refuses to stop. The tetrachord is still there in the bass, but now it drives rather than weighs.

There's a tradition behind this transformation. In Irish and Appalachian wakes, dancing at the graveside wasn't disrespect—it was assertion. The living claim their hours in the face of the inevitable. "Death, where is thy sting?" isn't just theology; it's biography.

The B section (Trio) provides contrast in 3/4 time, and here something interesting happens: the F natural of A minor becomes F#, shifting the mode to A Dorian. This brightening—associated with Celtic and modal music—carries a sense of defiant hope.

The final coda moves to 4/4 for the *apotheosis*: the tetrachord in augmentation, one note per bar, *fortississimo*. The descent is still there, but now it sounds like fanfare rather than lament. The final chord is a pure, blazing A minor—not resolution in the traditional sense, but affirmation.

## III. On Form and Transformation

What does it mean to write a "Metamorphoses"?

The title echoes Ovid, of course—those 15 books of transformations, humans becoming trees and rivers and stones. But it also recalls the classical tradition of variation form, from Bach's Goldberg Variations through Beethoven's Diabelli, Brahms's Haydn Variations, Elgar's Enigma. In all these works, a theme is subjected to continuous transformation while remaining somehow itself.

The descending tetrachord is perhaps the minimum viable theme—four notes, all stepwise, all descending. It can't be reduced further without ceasing to be recognizable. And yet it can be:

- **Rhythmicized** (quarter notes, running eighths, dotted figures)
- **Harmonized** (supporting major, minor, or modal harmonies)
- **Inverted** (the fugue plays with ascending versions)
- **Augmented** (stretched to one note per bar in the final coda)
- **Recontextualized** (F–E–D–C in the Intermezzo's F major)

The unity is melodic; the variety is everything else.

This is also, in a sense, what grief does. The loss remains the same—someone gone, something ended—but our relationship to it transforms. Rawness becomes numbness becomes anger becomes, perhaps, something approaching acceptance. The ground bass keeps falling, but what happens above it changes.

## IV. Performance Notes

**Passacaglia**: The challenge is sustaining intensity across eight variations while allowing for genuine contrast. The *pp* of Variation VI should feel like a physical release. The final measures should be barely audible.

**Fuga**: Clarity of voice-leading is paramount. Each instrument should be able to hear the subject entries in the other parts. The stretto should feel genuinely unstable—voices crowding each other—before the pedal point restores order.

**Intermezzo**: Rubato is welcome here; the 6/8 should breathe. The cello melody should sing without sentimentality—more night music than romance.

**Toccata**: The 7/8 must feel organic, not academic. Think of it as a dance with a limp, or a horse's gallop. The shift to 3/4 for the Trio should feel like sudden spaciousness. The final coda should be overwhelming—this is music that's earned its volume.

## V. A Note on Lament and Joy

There's a temptation, writing program notes for "serious" music, to lean into the darkness—to treat the lament as the essential message and the toccata's joy as some kind of escapism or denial.

But I think that gets it backward.

The tetrachord descends because that's what things do. Entropy increases. People leave. Bodies fail. The Buddhists call it *dukkha*—not suffering exactly, but the unsatisfactoriness built into conditioned existence. You don't need to be religious to notice that everything you love is going to end.

The question is what you do with that knowledge.

One answer is the passacaglia: you submit to the descent, let it repeat, find what beauty you can in the inevitability. Another answer is the fugue: you take the descending figure and make it argue with itself, generate complexity and counterpoint, build something intricate from simple grief.

But perhaps the most interesting answer is the toccata's: you dance. Not because you've forgotten that everything ends, but because you haven't. The dance on the grave isn't denial—it's defiance. Or maybe it's acceptance taken one step further, into something that looks from the outside like joy.

The tetrachord is still falling in the toccata. It never stops falling. But something else is happening too: the living are claiming their hours.
