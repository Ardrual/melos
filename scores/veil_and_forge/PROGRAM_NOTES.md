# Veil and Forge

Veil and Forge is a three-movement quartet about material that is rewritten rather than replaced. The opening movement moves in a slow, processional 4/4, with a short, downward-leaning motif that keeps resurfacing in different registers as if the music is re-reading itself. The harmony stays close to D minor, but the suspensions and passing tones leave a faint impression of something older underneath.

The second movement turns inward. In a subdued 3/4, the quartet becomes translucent: long lines, quiet chords, and a restrained warmth in Bb major. The music never fully settles; it lingers on the edge of the phrase, letting the silences be part of the melody.

The final movement is the forge. In a quick 6/8, the quartet moves into D major with a bright, kinetic pulse and a more extroverted texture. The lines interlock and spiral upward, bringing a feeling of heat and motion that resolves the earlier restraint into a clear, luminous finish.

Performance notes: keep movement I compact and focused, with a firm rhythmic pulse and little indulgence in rubato. Movement II should breathe, with long bow strokes and careful balance so the inner voice can be heard. Movement III is best played with clean articulation and lightness in the bow to preserve clarity at speed.
