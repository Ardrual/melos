# Fault Lines

Fault Lines is a four-movement quartet that treats a small descending idea like a fracture that keeps reappearing in different materials. The opening movement, “Seam,” moves in an uneven 5/4 to suggest a slow shift underfoot. The motif is intentionally modest—short steps rather than grand leaps—so its persistence becomes the focus rather than its size.

“Quiet Pressure” is a restrained slow movement in G major. The quartet narrows its range, and the voices lean into long tones and soft cadences. The harmonic language is clear, but the phrases avoid easy closure, as if the ground is still humming beneath the surface.

“Shear” is the kinetic center of the work: a 6/8 movement that threads brisk counterlines through B minor. Here the same idea becomes a spinning, almost mechanical pattern, and the quartet trades weight for speed.

The finale, “Rebuild,” is a passacaglia in E minor. A repeating bass pattern anchors the movement while the upper voices recombine earlier gestures into a more stable, forward-leaning line. The piece closes not with eruption but with a steadying, assembled cadence.

Performance notes: keep movement I tight and rhythmically clear, emphasizing the 5/4 pulse without exaggeration. In movement II, allow the long lines to bloom but keep the dynamic ceiling low. Movement III benefits from light bowing and crisp articulation. For the finale, make the bass pattern unmistakable and let the upper voices widen in intensity as the pattern repeats.
