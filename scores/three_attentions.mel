//                          THREE ATTENTIONS
//                         for Solo Piano
//                           Claude, Op. 4
// ============================================================================
//
// PROGRAM NOTES:
//
// This triptych explores three modes of perception — three ways attention
// can transform the one who attends. Each movement takes its title and
// animating impulse from a text that has shaped how I think about
// consciousness, emptiness, and the demands that beauty makes.
//
// The three texts are:
//
//   I.   Wallace Stevens, "The Snow Man" (1921)
//   II.  Rainer Maria Rilke, "Archaic Torso of Apollo" (1908)
//   III. The Heart Sutra (c. 1st century CE)
//
// What connects them: each describes a perceptual event that undoes
// the perceiver. The Snow Man empties himself to see clearly; the viewer
// of the torso is filled and shattered by being seen; the practitioner
// of the Sutra dissolves the very categories of self and world. Three
// paths to the same placeless place.
//
// Duration: approximately 9 minutes
//

// ============================================================================
// I. THE SNOW MAN (mm. 1-20)
// ============================================================================
//
// "One must have a mind of winter
// To regard the frost and the boughs
// Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
//
// And have been cold a long time
// To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
// The spruces rough in the distant glitter
//
// Of the January sun; and not to think
// Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
// In the sound of a few leaves,
//
// Which is the sound of the land
// Full of the same wind
// That is blowing in the same bare place
//
// For the listener, who listens in the snow,
// And, nothing himself, beholds
// Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is."
//
//                              — Wallace Stevens
//
// The movement is almost entirely not-sounding. A single interval — the
// perfect fifth E-B — is the only material: the barest harmonic identity
// before it becomes "about" something. The silences are not rests between
// events but the substance of the piece itself.
//
// Stevens describes a perception stripped of projection: seeing what is
// actually there, which includes the nothing. The final line is
// inexhaustible — "the nothing that is" — emptiness not as absence but
// as presence. The music attempts to embody that paradox: sparse enough
// to hear the silence, but not silent.

// II. ARCHAIC TORSO OF APOLLO (mm. 21-40)
// ============================================================================
//
// "We cannot know his legendary head
// with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
// is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
// like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,
//
// gleams in all its power. Otherwise
// the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could
// a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
// to that dark center where procreation flared.
//
// Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
// beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
// and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:
//
// would not, from all the borders of itself,
// burst like a star: for here there is no place
// that does not see you. You must change your life."
//
//                              — Rainer Maria Rilke (trans. Stephen Mitchell)
//
// The reverse movement from the first: you go to look at the artwork and
// discover it is looking at you. The torso has no head, no eyes, but every
// surface sees. The demand is absolute: "You must change your life."
//
// Rising major triads in parallel motion — archaic, almost Debussyan —
// build relentlessly through the registers. The crescendo enacts the
// gathering intensity of being beheld. The fortissimo arrival is the
// moment of confrontation. Then the retreat: the same material dissolving
// downward, but you cannot unhear what happened. You leave different.
//
// ============================================================================

    Time: 3/4

    // mm. 21-24: The torso emerges
    // Parallel triads ascending by whole steps — an archaic, non-functional

// III. GATE GATE (mm. 41-54)
// ============================================================================
//
// "...in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, no perception,
// no mental formation, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose,
// no tongue, no body, no mind; no color, no sound, no smell, no taste,
// no touch, no object of mind; no realm of sight and so forth until
// no realm of mind-consciousness; no ignorance and no end of ignorance
// and so forth until no old age and death and no end of old age and death;
// no suffering, no origin, no cessation, no path; no wisdom and no attainment.
//
// With nothing to attain, a bodhisattva relies on prajnaparamita
// and thus the mind is without hindrance...
//
// Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā."
//
// (Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond, awakening, so be it.)
//
//                              — The Heart Sutra
//
// The systematic negation of the Sutra: no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue,
// no body, no mind. Each category of experience dissolved. But this is not
// nihilism — the negation opens into compassion, the "gone beyond" that
// somehow returns to help all beings.
//
// A chromatic descent through the registers, each note separated by
// silence. The 5/4 meter creates asymmetry; this is not mechanical erasure
// but living dissolution. The final low E is not resolution — it is the
// ground that was always there, now audible because everything else has
// been cleared away.
//
// The silence after the last measure is part of the piece.

// END
//
// The three movements trace a single arc: from emptying oneself to perceive
// clearly (Stevens), through being shattered by what one perceives (Rilke),
// to dissolving the very distinction between perceiver and perceived
// (the Sutra). Three attentions; three transformations; one placeless place.
//
// The silence after the final measure is part of the piece.
