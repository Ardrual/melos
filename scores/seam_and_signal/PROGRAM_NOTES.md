# Seam and Signal

Seam and Signal is a three-movement quartet built from a small, stubborn cell: a minor-second dip followed by a sixth-leap and a stepwise fall. Rather than dramatic development, the piece treats the motif as a structural seam, a line the music keeps returning to as it reorients its balance and pacing.

The first movement, "Seam," is cast in 5/4 and anchored by a low A–E pulse in the cello. The upper voices circle a tight tonal field, testing the motif in different registers and occasionally tilting the harmony toward brightness before sinking back into A minor. The irregular meter should feel steady, not lurching.

"Glass Drift" slows the tempo and stretches the same material into long, quiet arcs in 3/2. The quartet becomes translucent: lines are spare, suspensions are allowed to linger, and the sense of motion comes from gentle harmonic shifts rather than rhythmic drive.

The finale, "Signal," converts the motif into a fast 6/8 pattern in A major. The texture tightens into interlocking lines, and the earlier instability resolves into a clear cadence. The movement should feel like release without becoming triumphant.

Performance notes: in movement I, keep the pulse grounded and the inner voices slightly forward to emphasize the seam. In movement II, sustain the long tones with minimal vibrato and careful balance. In movement III, maintain light articulation and crisp ensemble so the fast lines stay transparent.
