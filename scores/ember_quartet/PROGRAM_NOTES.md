# Ember Quartet

Ember Quartet traces a small heat that refuses to go out. The first movement listens to a low, smoldering pedal and lets the upper strings circle it in short, cautious phrases. The material is spare and the harmony stays close to D minor, but the lines are tuned to the pull of the leading tone, as if the music keeps testing whether the glow will flare or fade.

The second movement turns the same impulse outward. In 6/8, the quartet runs light-footed through F major, with a bright, dancing surface that still carries the earlier gravity in its inner voices. The motion is not purely exuberant; it is the quickness of embers lifting in a draft, quick to catch and quick to fall. The result is a compact arc: dark heat, then a brief, shimmering release.

Performance notes: keep the first movement close and restrained, with minimal vibrato in the opening measures. In the second, lean into the rhythmic lift of the 6/8 while keeping articulations clean so the lines remain transparent across the four voices.
