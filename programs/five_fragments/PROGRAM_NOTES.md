# Five Fragments
### A Song Cycle for Clarinet and Piano

---

## Preface

The song cycle—*Liederkreis*, *cycle de mélodies*—has always been a marriage of poetry and music, the human voice carrying text into the realm of pure sound. But what happens when we remove the voice? When the singer's breath becomes the clarinetist's, when words dissolve into melody alone?

*Five Fragments* attempts this translation. Each movement takes a poem—ranging from Sappho's antiquity to the early twentieth century—and renders it through the clarinet's extraordinary vocal range, from chalumeau depths to clarion heights. The piano provides not mere accompaniment but a second consciousness, sometimes commenting, sometimes completing, sometimes contradicting the melodic line.

The clarinet was chosen deliberately. Among wind instruments, it most closely approximates the human voice in its capacity for dynamic nuance, its seamless register transitions, and its ability to suggest both intimacy and grandeur. In these songs without words, it becomes the singer.

## The Poems and Their Music

### I. The Lake Isle of Innisfree
*After W.B. Yeats (1890)*

**G major | 6/8 | ♩. = 66**

Yeats wrote this poem while homesick in London, standing on Fleet Street, when a fountain in a shop window brought rushing back memories of Sligo. The poem's famous opening—the resolution to "arise and go now"—is one of literature's great expressions of pastoral longing.

The music captures this in several ways: the 6/8 meter creates a gentle, rocking motion suggestive of water; the key of G major evokes the pastoral tradition from Beethoven's Sixth Symphony to English folk song; the piano's rippling arpeggios suggest both "lake water lapping" and the hum of the "bee-loud glade."

The clarinet's melody is deliberately simple, almost folk-like, rising and falling in long, breathing phrases. The recapitulation returns more quietly, as if the dream of Innisfree has become internalized—heard "in the deep heart's core."

### II. Fire and Ice
*After Robert Frost (1920)*

**D minor | 4/4 | ♩ = 108 / 72**

Frost's nine-line poem on apocalypse is deceptively simple: will the world end in fire (desire) or ice (hate)? The poem's wit lies in its casual weighing of catastrophes, the speaker's almost conversational tone while discussing annihilation.

The music literalizes the contrast. The "Fire" section blazes upward in D minor, the clarinet climbing urgently while the piano drives with rhythmic intensity. Then, a measure of silence—the turn. The "Ice" section drops to nearly half tempo, the same material now descending in cold parallel motion, pp to ppp, all passion frozen.

The piece is brief—as Frost's poem is brief—but covers enormous emotional distance in its minute-and-a-half span.

### III. Sappho Fragment 31
*After Sappho (c. 600 BCE)*

**E minor | 5/4 and 4/4 | ♩ = 80 / 92 / 72 / 88**

Fragment 31 is perhaps the most influential love poem in Western literature. The speaker watches her beloved talking with someone else and catalogs her own physical dissolution: voice fails, fire runs under the skin, eyes go blind, ears ring, sweat pours, trembling seizes the body. "I am greener than grass," Sappho writes, "and seem to myself almost dead."

The music attempts to capture both the intensity and the fragmentation. The unusual 5/4 meter creates asymmetry and unease. Tempo fluctuates as the speaker's state shifts—calm observation, voice failing (halting phrases, silence), fire under the skin (accelerando, rising scales), the overwhelmed stillness, and finally the trembling return.

The piano's accompaniment is broken, fragmentary, full of silences—suggesting both the damaged state of the papyrus from which we have these lines and the speaker's shattered composure. The clarinet's phrases are interrupted, gasping, rarely completing a full thought.

### IV. Nothing Gold Can Stay
*After Robert Frost (1923)*

**E major | 3/4 | ♩ = 56**

Eight lines on transience: nature's first green is gold, but nothing gold can stay. The golden leaves of early spring become green; Eden fell; dawn becomes day. The poem moves from botanical observation to the Fall of Man in six couplets.

The music is correspondingly brief and precious. E major, with its four sharps, has a bright, otherworldly quality—golden, one might say. The tempo is slow, each note weighted, each phrase a small eternity that passes too quickly.

The clarinet melody descends through the entire song, from G#4 to G#3 and lower, enacting the "subsiding" of which Frost writes. The final clarinet note fades to nothing (ppp), the piano holding an E major chord like the last light of a sunset.

This is the cycle's center of gravity, its still point—the briefest movement, but in some ways the emotional core.

### V. Ulysses
*After Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1842)*

**D major | 4/4 | ♩ = 72 / 84 / 96**

The aged hero of the Odyssey, home at last, finds he cannot rest. Though old, though "made weak by time and fate," he resolves to sail once more: "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."

This finale answers the cycle's earlier poems. Against Frost's ice and Sappho's dissolution, against even Yeats's gentle pastoral retreat, Tennyson offers defiance. The music builds inexorably from the hero's restlessness through the rallying of companions to the climactic declaration.

D major is the key of triumph (Beethoven's Ninth, Handel's Hallelujah Chorus), and the music earns it by degrees. The clarinet begins in the middle register, almost speaking, but climbs through the rallying section into its brilliant upper range. The final pages are frankly heroic—fortissimo chords, the clarinet blazing on high A6, a conclusion that refuses to yield.

## Performance Notes

The cycle runs approximately 12-15 minutes and should be performed without pause between movements, though brief breaths are appropriate after each piece settles.

Dynamic markings should be observed carefully—much of the cycle's expressive range lies in its contrasts between ppp and fff. The clarinet's ability to diminish to nearly nothing (especially in movements I and IV) is essential.

Tempo fluctuations within movements III and V are structural, not interpretive suggestions. The performers should feel free, however, to find their own rubato within phrases.

## A Note on Texts

This cycle sets poems without singing them—an apparent paradox. Yet the Romantic *Lied* tradition has always held that the voice and instrument together create something neither could alone. Here, the clarinet assumes the voice's role while the poems remain present as ghosts, shaping every phrase even in their textual absence.

Listeners may wish to read the poems before hearing the music, or they may prefer to let the instrumental versions stand alone. Either approach is valid. The music neither requires the texts nor replaces them—it exists in dialogue with them, across the centuries that separate Sappho from Tennyson, Tennyson from us.
